 ### GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                                  
   This scripts evaluates real hemispherical images to estimate local sky view fraction and below-canopy shortwave radiation if the image is taken inside a forest.

 ### OUTPUT                                                               
   The script has a number of optional outputs, which include         
   - reclassification of image (canopy, terrain, sky, solar track)    
   - shortwave radiation (per horizontal, inclined, sun-facing area)  
   - sky view fraction (for flat and/or hemispherical sensor)         
                                                                      
 ### METHODS                                                              
   The scripts includes the following steps (some of them being optional):                                                         
   - grayscale image (according to external input on threshold and thresholding method)                                             
   - correct image distortion (using a lens-specific profile)         
     note: this is an essential feature and should not be skipped     
   - mask surrounding terrain and add to image (based on DEM)         
     note: helps to avoid misclassification of snow on the ground     
   - calculate sky view fraction                                      
   - calculate position of sun (according to formulas by NOAA)        
   - plot sun disk on image behind canopy / terrain elements to evaluate the transmissivity of direct radiation through the canopy                                                           
   - split swr data measured at open site into diffuse/direct radiation (according to formulas in FSM 1.0 by R. Essery)        
     note: potential swr is used if no measurements are available     
   - calculate sub-canopy swr based on diffuse radiation times sky view fraction plus direct radiation times transmissivity         
                                                                      
 ### NOTATION                                                             
   local spherical coordinates are given as [rad,tht,phi], where     
   - rad is radial distance in [m]                                    
   - tht is zenith angle (theta) in degree, i.e.                      
       sun @ zenith is tht = 0;                                       
       sun @ horizon is tht = 90                                      
   - phi is azimuthal angle (phi) in degree, where                    
       0째 is North                                                    
       90째 is East                                                    
       180째 is South                                                  
       270째 is West                                                   
       note that hemispherical images are taken upwards so that azimuthal angles increase in counterclockwise direction, i.e. South is up if West is left                               
                                                                      
 ### SETTINGS                                                             
   All settings such as paths to I/O data and model parameters are handled through an external settings file the path/filename of which is the only input argument to this script                    
                                                                      
 ### USAGE                                                                
   run from the Matlab command line: HPEval('HPEval_Settings.m')
